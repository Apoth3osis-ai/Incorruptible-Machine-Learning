# Incorruptible-Machine-Learning
To create an efficient and reliable way for third-party users to input their training data and fine-tune their models using the provided immutable logging framework, we should design a user-friendly interface or a set of well-documented functions. This will allow users to easily integrate their data and models into the process.

## Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:
* Function-based Design: Encapsulate the entire process into functions that users can call with their data and models.
* Documentation and Examples: Provide clear documentation and examples to guide users.
* Configuration File: Allow users to specify their hyperparameters and other configurations in a configuration file.
# Code Implementation
* Step 1: Define Functions
* Setup Environment: Initialize directories and import necessary libraries.
* Prepare Data: Load and preprocess the data.
* Hash Data: Create hashes for training data.
* Define Model: Allow users to define their own model.
* Train Model with Hashing: Train the model with hashing callbacks.
* Save Metadata: Save hyperparameters and training script.
* Verification: Verify the integrity of the training process.

# Explanation for Third-Party Users
## Function Definitions:
* setup_environment(): Initializes directories and imports necessary libraries.
* create_hash(data): Creates cryptographic hashes for data.
* prepare_data(data, target): Prepares and standardizes the dataset.
* hash_training_data(X_train): Hashes training data blocks and stores the hashes.
* define_model(input_shape): Defines the model architecture.
* save_metadata(hyperparameters, training_script): Saves hyperparameters and training script metadata and returns their hash.
* train_model_with_hashing(model, X_train, y_train, hyperparameters): Trains the model with hashing callbacks.
* maintain_logs(data_audit_trail, epochs): Maintains and stores audit logs.
* verify_audit_trail(audit_logs, X_train): Verifies the integrity of the training data and model weights.
* run_immutable_training(data, target, hyperparameters, training_script): Orchestrates the entire process.

# Example Usage:
Users can input their dataset (data and target), hyperparameters, and training script to run_immutable_training().
# Documentation
* Setup Environment: Initializes necessary directories and imports required libraries.
* Data Preparation: Splits and standardizes the input dataset.
* Hashing: Hashes training data blocks and model weights after each epoch.
* Model Definition: Allows users to define and compile their model.
* Metadata Logging: Logs hyperparameters and training scripts.
* Training with Hashing: Trains the model and logs hashes.
* Verification: Verifies the integrity of the training data and model weights.
  
By using this structured approach, third-party users can efficiently and reliably input their training data and fine-tune their models while ensuring the integrity of the training process through immutable logging.

# Post-Quantum Secure Immutable Machine Learning

This project enhances the original immutable machine learning framework by incorporating a post-quantum secure hash function. The goal is to ensure the integrity and security of the training data and model weights, even in the presence of potential quantum computer attacks.

## Key Updates

1. **Post-Quantum Secure Hash Function**: The SHA-256 hash function has been replaced with SHAKE256, a variant of the SHA-3 hash function family. SHAKE256 provides adjustable output length and is considered to be secure against quantum computer attacks.

2. **Updated Hashing Implementation**: The `create_hash` function has been modified to utilize the SHAKE256 hash function from the `pycryptodome` library. The function now takes an additional parameter `output_length` to specify the desired length of the hash output in bytes (default is 64 bytes, equivalent to 512 bits).

3. **Consistent Hashing**: All occurrences of `hashlib.sha256` in the code have been replaced with calls to the updated `create_hash` function to ensure consistent usage of the post-quantum secure hash function throughout the project.

## Installation

To use this updated version of the immutable machine learning framework, make sure to install the `pycryptodome` library by running the following command: pip install pycryptodome

This library provides the SHAKE256 hash function used in the updated code.

## Usage

The usage of the immutable machine learning framework remains the same as in the original version. Users can input their dataset, hyperparameters, and training script to the `run_immutable_training` function to train their models while ensuring data integrity and immutability.

Please note that while SHAKE256 is currently considered post-quantum secure, it is important to stay updated with the latest developments in post-quantum cryptography and adjust the hash function as needed to maintain long-term security.

For more details on the implementation and usage of the immutable machine learning framework, please refer to the original documentation.

## Step-by-Step Plan
1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
2. Data Chunking and Hashing
3. Storing Hashes in a Separate Log
4. RAG System Integration
5. Verification of Data Validity

## Detailed Steps

### Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
**Task:** Ingest and preprocess the data.
**Tools:** Python, NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy), Text cleaning libraries (re, BeautifulSoup).

```python
import re
import spacy
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def preprocess_text(text):
    text = BeautifulSoup(text, "html.parser").get_text()
    text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)
    text = text.lower()
    return text

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example usage
text = "Daffodils are always yellow. In some gardens, you may find a red daffodil."
clean_text = preprocess_text(text)

```
# Data Chunking and Hashing
* Task: Chunk the data (e.g., per word, paragraph, page, chapter) and create hashes.
* Tools: Python, hashlib.
* 
```python
import hashlib

def create_hash(data):
    data_str = json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)
    return hashlib.sha256(data_str.encode()).hexdigest()

def chunk_data(text, level="paragraph"):
    if level == "word":
        return text.split()
    elif level == "sentence":
        doc = nlp(text)
        return [sent.text for sent in doc.sents]
    elif level == "paragraph":
        return text.split('\n\n')
    # Add more levels as needed (e.g., page, chapter)
    else:
        return [text]

def hash_chunks(chunks):
    return [create_hash(chunk) for chunk in chunks]

# Example usage
chunks = chunk_data(clean_text, level="paragraph")
hashes = hash_chunks(chunks)
print(hashes)
```
# Storing Hashes in a Separate Log
* Task: Store the hashes in a separate log.
* Tools: Python, file handling.

```python
import json

def store_hash_log(hashes, log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'w') as f:
        for h in hashes:
            f.write(json.dumps({"hash": h}) + '\n')

# Example usage
store_hash_log(hashes, 'logs/hash_log.json')
```
# RAG System Integration
* Task: Integrate the RAG system for data retrieval and augmentation.
* Tools: RAG model from Hugging Face.

```python
from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagSequenceForGeneration

# Initialize RAG model components
tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq")
retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq", index_name="custom")
model = RagSequenceForGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq", retriever=retriever)

def rag_generate(input_text):
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    output = model.generate(**inputs)
    return tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example usage
input_text = "What is General Relativity?"
generated_output = rag_generate(input_text)
print(generated_output)
```

# Verification of Data Validity
* Task: Verify the data validity by rehashing and comparing to the stored log.
* Tools: Python, hashlib.

```python
def verify_data(chunks, log_file):
    new_hashes = hash_chunks(chunks)
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        stored_hashes = [json.loads(line.strip())["hash"] for line in f]
    
    for new_hash, stored_hash in zip(new_hashes, stored_hashes):
        if new_hash != stored_hash:
            print("Data integrity check failed!")
            return False
    print("Data integrity verified.")
    return True

# Example usage
chunks = chunk_data(clean_text, level="paragraph")
verify_data(chunks, 'logs/hash_log.json')
```
# Summary

* Ingest and Preprocess Data: Clean and standardize the text from the article.
* Chunk and Hash Data: Divide the data into chunks and create hashes.
* Store Hashes: Save the hashes in a separate log for future reference.
* Integrate with RAG System: Use the RAG model to enhance data retrieval and generation.
* Verify Data Validity: Rehash the data during retrieval and compare it to the stored hashes to ensure consistency and integrity.

By following this workflow, users can verify the internal consistency of their data using hashing and logging mechanisms. This approach ensures that the data used in the RAG system is reliable and unchanged, maintaining high integrity and trustworthiness.
